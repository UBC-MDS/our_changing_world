# Improvements made for Milestone 4

### 1. Comments from TAs

**1.1. Comments:** I agree that changing the world map to a heat map with different scale for each of the variables or altering the bubble sizes might show the differences between countries a bit better.

**Our response:** The heatmap was meant for showing association amongst the variables and not in place of the world map. However, given the few variables in our dataset, and no variation of GDP per capita and Life Expectancy with Population, we deemed it prudent to show the evolution of the association between GDP per capita and Life Expectancy as a bubble chart, adjusted by Population. @[commit 16dab](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/our_changing_world/commit/16dab20f3f32d3365d8ef35e66bb1b1869d3c8fc)
